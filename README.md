### Who is GeosMeos :grey_question:

My name is George and i'm a techy with passion for learning new stuff.

Automation and integration are my best qualities with python and bash under the hood.

I have some devops related projects(terraform, ansible and k8s) as i'm looking to expand my knowledge.

Here are some of my interests:
* Fiddle with technologies, both old and new :collision:
* Setting up working environments and infrastructures (VMs, containers and cloud) :cloud:
* Solving day-to-day problems with python and bash :snake:
* Exploring the browser's network tab :mag_right:


I'd urge you to checkout some of my public projects:
* [wolt-sort-app](https://github.com/GeosMeos/wolt-sort-app) - A flask app that wraps around the Wolt API and returns sorted results.
* [devops_task](https://github.com/GeosMeos/devops_task) - A small project i did as part of an interview, setting up a cloud infrastructure with LAMP and WP.
* [k8s](https://github.com/GeosMeos/k8s) - My first try at kubernetes.
